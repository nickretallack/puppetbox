I could totally change the persistence methods for this thing, and make it have a consistent API so they could be easily swapped.

Postgres / SQL

Works pretty nicely, but it might be getting pegged when you move things around.  I should make a custom debouncing solution for when you move items by using setTimeouts keyed to the item's ID.
Also it's a little over-complicated for what I'm doing.

Flat Files per Room

I could totally do it all with flat files.  Just keep everything in memory and debounce writes in case the server goes down and I'm good.  Hm.






When a user pastes an image
    Send a create object event
    Set the image to ajax spinner (make that the default image)
    Read as binary and hash the image.
    When it's loaded
        If it's new to this client
            Do a head request for it
            Ask the server if it knows about it
                If the server knows
                    have the server broadcast the url
                If the server doesn't know
                    Start uploading the image
                    When the image upload finishes
                        have the server broadcast its new url to all clients.
        If we've used it before on this client
            Use the cached image url

-- use the data url?


image / object

When you paste a file, it should display as soon as possible using data urls.
As soon as it's displayed, you can move it.



You paste a file.  It uploads to the server.  The server then gives you a url for it.



  You download it and display it.
